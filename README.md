**FUTURE_DS_01**

This **repository** is my first project from my internship at Future Interns, where I utilized the Titanic Dataset EDA: Data cleaning, visualization, and pattern identification.
Titanic Survival Rate Analysis
**Goal**: To analyze the Titanic dataset and identify factors that influenced passenger survival rates.

**Methodology:**

    1. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and characteristics.
    2. Employed data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.
    3. Utilized data transformation methods to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
    4. Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between different variables.
    4. Visualized key findings using heatmaps, countplots, distplots, and boxplots to uncover patterns and relationships.

**Tools and Libraries:**

    1. Jupyter Notebook
    2. Python programming language
    3. Pandas
    4. NumPy
    5. Matplotlib
    6. Seaborn

  **Key Findings:**
        - The majority of the people on the Titanic were ranging from Age 18 to 35 (youth), whereas from age 60 and above were less represented.
        - The maximum number of the people on the Titanic did not have any sibling or spouse.
        - Many people from first class (rich) survived, followed by the lower class (surprisingly), then the middle class.
        - Many females survived more than males, whereas many males died than females.
   **Conclusion:** The project successfully identified several factors that influenced passenger survival rates on the Titanic, including age, gender, and passenger class.
    Future Work: The insights gained from this EDA can be used to build predictive models for survival rates, potentially incorporating additional variables and machine learning techniques.

**Python** (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn,..etc), Jupyter Notebook, etc.

Give me a **feedback** or **suggestions** for improvement in this journey.
